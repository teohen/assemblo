# assemblo
**Assemblo Project** is a programming platform designed to help programmers understand the fundamentals of computer architecture and low-level logic.

**Assemblo**, a pseudo-Assembly language that supports data manipulation and processing through [instructions](/docs?item=instructions) that operates on [registers](/docs?item=registers) and [memory](/docs?item=memory) slots. Programmers can use **Assemblo** to solve a series of coding challenges and improve their knowledge.

The platform includes an integrated **Online Coder** that allows programmers to write and execute their Assemblo code providing a visualization of the execution process. Programmers can observe the program's internal state in real-time, tracking essential components like **register values**, the contents of **memory slots**, and the flow of control via the **line counter**.

The documentation to the **Assemblo** can be found in the [Assemblo Docs](/docs?item=assemblo).
